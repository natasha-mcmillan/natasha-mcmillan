### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Natasha
#### I am a software developer with a passion for data analysis!
My choice language for personal projects is Python. I especially like Python due to its tools such as: PANDAS, Matplotlib, etc. 

One of my favourite things about technology is that it is constantly evolving; it's impossible to stop learning when you're working in an ever-changing field. 

I enjoy development because it enables me, to enable others, to use technology; I am passionate about helping others, and technology can vastly improve the lives of many!

Skills: PYTHON / JAVA / C# / SSIS / AGILE
